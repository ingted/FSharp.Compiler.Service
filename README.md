# F# Compiler Service

The FSharp.Compiler.Service package contains a custom build of the F# compiler that
exposes additional functionality for implementing F# language bindings, additional
tools based on the compiler or refactoring tools. The package also includes F#
interactive service that can be used for embedding F# scripting into your applications. This repository exists entirely to create and publish that package.

## Purpose

> This repo is (mostly) **read only**

This repo exists as a downstream packaging repository for the [FSharp.Compiler.Service](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Compiler.Service) NuGet Package. It serves the following purposes _only_:


* Release packaging
* Hosting [public documentation](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/)
* Serving as a stable base for Fable

It is a fork of the official F# source repository, which is located at [dotnet/fsharp](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp). **All** issues and contributions should be raised there. All feature development should be targeted there. Once contributions are accepted into [dotnet/fsharp](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp), they will be integrated into this repository for packaging and release.

If you need to add customizations to FSharp.Compiler.Service for your own uses, you should clone [dotnet/fsharp](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp) and build the FSharp.Compiler.Service binaries from there. The process is exactly the same as it is described below.

### No contribution is too small

Even if you find a single-character typo, we're happy to take the change! Although the codebase can feel daunting for beginners, we and other contributors are happy to help you along.
